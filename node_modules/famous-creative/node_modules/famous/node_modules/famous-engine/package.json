A Famous application can be run once, once a second, 60 times a second, once every time a certain message comes through, etc.  We currently provide three types of engines each with their own usecase.\n\n- Engine.js: An engine designed to work with the browser's requestAnimationFrame such that the application will be updated at max 60 times a second.  This is the default engine of Famous\n- ContainerEngine.js: An engine designed to work with the Famous container system.  It allows the ability to have applications easily be controlled by a master application.\n- DebuggingEngine.js: An engine designed to be called directly from the console.  This allows the developer to debug applications one frame at a time.\n\n## Tests\n\nMake sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.\n\nInstall the development dependencies\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```sh\nnpm run test\n```\n\n#### Visual Tests\n\nVisual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCloning this repository directly is primarily for those wishing to contribute to our codebase. Check out our [contributing instructions](https://github.com/Famous/famous/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved. \n    \nNote: cloning only provides the library of components and not the entire platform nor any application scaffolding.\n  \n## Documentation\n\nAPI documentation is available on our website in the [docs](https://famo.us/docs) section.  It is also available inside the [famous platform](https://github.com/famous/famous) repository.  API documentation is generated directly from the source code so feel free to dig into it here also.\n\nSpecific examples can be found [here](https://github.com/famous/examples).\n\nLessons on the Famous platform are available [here](https://famo.us/university).\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [famous-polyfills](https://github.com/Famous/polyfills)\n\n## License\n\nAll rights reserved.
