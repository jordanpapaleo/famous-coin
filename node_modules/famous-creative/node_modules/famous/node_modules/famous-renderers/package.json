  "readme": "renderers\n=================\n\nThe renderers repository is a module designed to work with the Famous platform.  Renderers provides a medium independent interface for accepting draw commands. The role of renderers is to take the generic scene information and then pass on the medium specific (DOM, WebGL, etc) instructions to their particular renderers.  Compositor serves as the master renderer and has the responsibility for providing extra features such as DOM and WebGL layering.\n\n## Tests\n\nMake sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.\n\nInstall the development dependencies\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```sh\nnpm run test\n```\n\n#### Visual Tests\n\nVisual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCloning this repository directly is primarily for those wishing to contribute to our codebase. Check out our [contributing instructions](https://github.com/Famous/famous/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved. \n    \nNote: cloning only provides the library of components and not the entire platform nor any application scaffolding.\n  \n## Documentation\n\nAPI documentation is available on our website in the [docs](https://famo.us/docs) section.  It is also available inside the [famous platform](https://github.com/famous/famous) repository.  API documentation is generated directly from the source code so feel free to dig into it here also.\n\nSpecific examples can be found [here](https://github.com/famous/examples).\n\nLessons on the Famous platform are available [here](https://famo.us/university).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [famous-components](https://github.com/Famous/components)\n- [famous-dom-renderers](https://github.com/Famous/dom-renderers)\n- [famous-webgl-renderers](https://github.com/Famous/webgl-renderers)\n- [famous-utilities](https://github.com/Famous/utilities)\n\n## License\n\nAll rights reserved.
