physics
=================

Physics is a platform that was designed to help developers and designers create animations and interactions that feel natural and intuative.  The physics platform is designed to work well with the Famous platform but is modular enough to be used outside of Famous.  It has the ability to perform simulations of thousands of discrete objects beign affected by various forces and constraints.  If you need collisions, natural feeling springs, gravity, or any other physical interaction, try modeling it with the physics platform.

## Tests

Make sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.

Install the development dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Run the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

#### Visual Tests

Visual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.

## Documentation

API documentation is available on our website in the [docs](https://famo.us/docs) section.  It is also available inside the [famous platform](https://github.com/famous/famous) repository.  API documentation is generated directly from the source code so feel free to dig into it here also.

Specific examples can be found [here](https://github.com/famous/examples).

Lessons on the Famous platform are available [here](https://famo.us/university).
