  "readme": "physics\n=================\n\nPhysics is a platform that was designed to help developers and designers create animations and interactions that feel natural and intuative.  The physics platform is designed to work well with the Famous platform but is modular enough to be used outside of Famous.  It has the ability to perform simulations of thousands of discrete objects beign affected by various forces and constraints.  If you need collisions, natural feeling springs, gravity, or any other physical interaction, try modeling it with the physics platform.\n\n## Tests\n\nMake sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.\n\nInstall the development dependencies\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```sh\nnpm run test\n```\n\n#### Visual Tests\n\nVisual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCloning this repository directly is primarily for those wishing to contribute to our codebase. Check out our [contributing instructions](https://github.com/Famous/famous/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved. \n    \nNote: cloning only provides the library of components and not the entire platform nor any application scaffolding.\n  \n## Documentation\n\nAPI documentation is available on our website in the [docs](https://famo.us/docs) section.  It is also available inside the [famous platform](https://github.com/famous/famous) repository.  API documentation is generated directly from the source code so feel free to dig into it here also.\n\nSpecific examples can be found [here](https://github.com/famous/examples).\n\nLessons on the Famous platform are available [here](https://famo.us/university).\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [famous-math](https://github.com/Famous/math)\n- [famous-utilities](https://github.com/Famous/utilities)\n\n## License\n\nAll rights reserved.
