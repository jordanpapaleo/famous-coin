webgl-geometries
=================

webgl-geometries is a library for creating 2D & 3D shapes to be used with WebGL.  This library comes with premade geometries such as Box, Cylinder, and Plane, as well as helper classes for defining a custom geometry.  Also included, the OBJLoader is a class designed to help load in external .obj files into the program in the same format as all of the other geometries.

## Tests

Make sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.

Install the development dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Run the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

#### Visual Tests

Visual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.
