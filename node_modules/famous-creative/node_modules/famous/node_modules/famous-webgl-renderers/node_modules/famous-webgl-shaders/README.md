webgl-shaders
=================

Webgl-shaders is a library of shaders to help aid in WebGL development.  These shaders were designed to work with the Famous platform but are well suited to be used on their own.

## Tests

Make sure that npm and a javascript platform (Node.js or io.js) are installed on your machine.

Install the development dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Run the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

#### Visual Tests

Visual tests can be found [here](http://github.com/Famous/visual-tests).  We use visual testing for debugging browser inconsistencies but they also serve as a great place to check out how to use the platform.
